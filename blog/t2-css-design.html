			Margin, Border, and Padding

			It's the second week of DBC! This week we learned about designing websites with techniques from HTML/CSS. Today, I'll be going over <b>margin</b>, <b>border</b>, and <b>padding</b>. 
			<p>
			So what's the difference between the 3?
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Padding</b> - the space between the <i>border</i> and your elements
			<br/><b>Border</b> - this is the border around your element, you can manipulat the border style, color, and thickness
			<br/><b>Margin</b> - this is the space around the entire element, after the border and the padding
			</p>
			<p>
			Imagine you're sending a package and you give the delivery guy really specific instructions.
			Let's say, this package is extremely fragile and you don't want it to collide with other boxes. 
			You tell him to keep it a specific distance away from other objects. This would be your <b>margin</b>. 
			Let's say you're even more paranoid and decide you want all the corners and edges taped up. This would
			be your <b>border</b>. Now, let's say you're shipping glass. You don't want it rolling around everywhere, so
			you ask the delivery guy for bubble wrap all around the inside of the box. This would be your <b>padding</b>. 
			</p>
			<p> 
			Here's a picture from <i>Googleimages</i> that can help with this visualization. 
			<br/><img src="http://doc.qt.digia.com/qq/qq20-boxmodel.png"/>
			</p>
			<p>
			What does the code look like? 
			<br/> You can specify the padding, margin, and border in your CSS stylesheet. A CSS stylesheet is a seperate file from your HTML file 
			which can control the overall look of your webpage. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<code>
			padding-top:20px
			<br/>padding-bottom:30px
			<br/>margin-left:auto
			<br/>margin-right:auto
			<br>border-left: 1px solid #00000
			</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			To manipulate both padding and margin, you can change the settings for all 4 sides at the same time, or do them individually. In the code above,
			I've manipulated them <i>individually</i>. To manipulate each side by the same amount, you can simply type: 
			</p>
			<p>
			<code>
			padding:20px
			<br/>margin: 20px
			</code>
			</P>
			<p>
			The <i>border</i> is a little different because there are different types of borders, colors, and widths you can have. But similar to <i>padding</i>
			and <i>margin</i>, you can also manipulate all 4 sides all at once or individually. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Individually:
			<br/>
			<code>
			border-bottom: 1px solid #000000;
			</code>
			</p>
			<p>
			All 4 at once
			<br/>
			<code>
			border: 1px solid #000000;
			</code>
			</p>
			<p> 
			The 1px specifies width, solid specifies the style, and #000000 specifies the color (which is black). All 3 of these settings can be changed. 
			</p>
			<p>
			I hope you learned something today because I am definitely learning a lot. It's a lot to take in all at once, but once you get to playing aroudn with these settings, 
			you can see your own visualization of a webpage come to life.
