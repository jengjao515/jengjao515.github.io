			After being accepted into Dev Bootcamp, we were told to do some pre-work that included
			discovering our individual <b>thinking styles</b> Even though I graduated in psychology, learning about thinking styles was one of the very first things you learned and so it 
			was a pretty good refresher for me.  When I retook the personality quiz, I had a tie 
			between two thinking styles, <b>Concrete Sequential and Abstract Sequential</b>. My scores in the other two styles, <i>Abstract Random and Concrete Random</i>, were pretty low in comparison. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Here are some quick definitions for the four: 
			<br/><b>Concrete Sequential</b> - consistent and effiecient thinkers, based in reality, likes things ordered and linear
			<br/><b>Abstract Sequential</b> - likes to learn, gathers facts from experts, does research, complete things thoroughly or not at all 
			<br/><i>Abstract Random</i> - have difficulty sharing what they know but learn the easiest, doesn't prefer detailed/sequential information
			<br/>Concrete Random</i> - prefer to learn through examples and how they relate to topics
			</p>
			<p>
			As the work piled on and the concepts became more difficult for me, I found myself needing notes, getting stuck for long periods of time because I didn't like having an answer that worked but never exactly sure why. This was the <i>Abstract Sequential</i> side of me that needed more than just finding the right answer through slight understanding of the challenge. After some research, I started writing down cheat sheets as a way to organize my thoughts and what I've learned so far. This was my <i>Concrete Sequential</i> side in me because I had every concept labeled as a method, value, etc. and even in what chapter of a book or what challenge we encountered it. I liked the idea of being able to go back and find a reference if my notes were insufficient. Physically writing things down and practicing topics also helps me learn and remember things better. Sometimes staring at a computer for too long, I can get distracted by getting off track. If I have paper in front of me where page needs to be turned, or something need to be crossed out/highlighted, at least I'm actively engaged and focused in something that gives my other body parts something to do.

			When I was applying to coding camps, I knew that college hadn't given me exactly what I wanted. A lot of my friends had become successful without applying too much effort in their college studies because, well, employers don't really care about GPAs, they care aboput experience. My college experience wasn't as smooth as I'd hoped it would be and in the process, I lost interest in it, but still graduated. I didn't like that idea, that I fell out of love of learning. So I felt a weird pull to the coding camps because they were concentrated, focused, and it actually looked like a challenge I was willing to take. I wanted a second chance to be a better student and for a future I could actually see myself in. Having a <b>growth mindset</b> when you go into these kinds of education is huge advantage. I wanted the challenge and I knew that at some points, I would probably be extremely poor at it. But at least, through the process, I knew I'd eventually get better. Learning would become a habit again, and not learning, well, would just feel like a waste of time.

			A <i>growth</i> mindset is better than a <i>fixed</i> mindset because you don't want to be focused on just the result of all your efforts, you also should gain something from the entire process. People who focus on their growth gain more than just a beautiful end result, they're also developing as human beings. People who have a more fixed mindset remind me of how I felt in college, it was about getting a degree to put up on your wall, not about the experience. I don't want to feel or be like that anymore and I feel that going to DBC has definitely helped with that aspect of my life.
