		For a long time, I've just struggled with <i>wanting</i> to do things. I'm really good at
		doing things for other people, but that took away most of the energy I had for doing anything for myself. So having any type of will-power is a big deal for me. Somedays it'll be there
		but most of the time it isn't. There are a lot of quotes around that say, "Fake it til you make it." I've tried that method for years and lying to myself never really worked out. So when I actually accomplish something through the bits of will-power I may have left, it's one of the few days I feel pretty good about myself.

		The last topic someone asked for me advice on was 'how to deal'. A friend of mine was having some personal issues and it was basically taking over his mental state. I don't really like giving generic advice, I prefer either giving it to you straight or making you ask yourself those
		questions. I feel this has a lot to do with Affection and Will-Power. You can either follow your gut or just go for it. It depends on how much you're willing to risk and if you're at least somewhat aware of the consequences. Is it worth it? Can you live with yourself? Can you get passed it? What are you losing but what can you gain? Lately, I've been feeling this are questions I ask myself a lot.

		When it comes to stereotype threat, it's all about fighting your natural instinct. This takes a lot of will-power. If you can overcome that, you'll definitely feel accomplished for at the least, trying.

		From what I learned so far from the program, it's really all about knowing that you're most likely not the only one feeling out of it. There may be some huge learning gaps between people, but most people will understand that some concepts may take more time to sink in then others. You have to maintain this perspective that you really aren't alone and don't be stubborn, ask for help. You have a bunch of other people in the room that are willing to walk you through it. I don't remember who wrote this quote, but it went something like, <b>"It doesn't matter how slow you go, as long as you don't stop."</b> So don't give up, if you're lost, ask someone to pull you back.
