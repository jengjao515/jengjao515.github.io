		My boyfriend built my PC a few months ago, but my favorite part of the setup, is definitely the keyboard. Although, it doesn't help that I already type loud to begin with (I'm working on it), there's something so satisfying about typing on a mechanical one. Unfortunately, my internet connection restricts me from playing a lot of games, it still gets me through a couple rounds
		of League of Legends. 
	<p>Okay, back to the keyboards. This is what my keyboard looks like. It's a CM Storm Rapidfire Stealth. Cherry MX Browns with rubber o-rings, tenkeyless. For the purpose of this blog post, I'll mainly talk about this specific build and some general keyboard information.</p>
	<p align=center><img src="../imgs/keyboards.png" /></p>
	<p> Before building my keyboard, we tested out what kind of 'feel' (aka <b>tactile feedback</b>), I wanted for the keys using a tester that looks like<a href="../imgs/cherrymx.jpg">this</a>. Just like any piece of hardware, there are multiple brands and builds you can get. There are also different types of keyboards such as <u><a href="https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=952&bih=824&q=full+size+keyboard&oq=full+size+keyboard&gs_l=img.3..0l6j0i30l2j0i5i30l2.405.2104.0.2702.18.11.0.0.0.0.284.1817.0j3j5.8.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.64.img..10.8.1814.7_GvOrPOxI0">full-sized</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=952&bih=824&q=full+size+keyboard&oq=full+size+keyboard&gs_l=img.3..0l6j0i30l2j0i5i30l2.405.2104.0.2702.18.11.0.0.0.0.284.1817.0j3j5.8.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.64.img..10.8.1814.7_GvOrPOxI0#tbm=isch&q=tenkeyless+keyboard">tenkeyless</a></u>, and <u><a href="https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=952&bih=824&q=full+size+keyboard&oq=full+size+keyboard&gs_l=img.3..0l6j0i30l2j0i5i30l2.405.2104.0.2702.18.11.0.0.0.0.284.1817.0j3j5.8.0.msedr...0...1ac.1.64.img..10.8.1814.7_GvOrPOxI0#tbm=isch&q=60%25+keyboard">60%</a></u>. I prefer the <b>tenkeyless</b> keyboards because of the arrow keys. On the smaller keyboards, the <B>WASD</b> keys act as the arrow keys. Although the smaller keyboards allow for more customization and less space to type over, I like having my keys separate.

	My switches are Cherry MX Browns. Other types include Cherry MX Blues and Reds. As mentioned earlier, the main difference between
	switches is the <u>tactile feedback</u> and the sound the keys make. Type something random on your computer, there's a feel to the keys. When I would type papers for school, I used to prefer the flat Mac-like keyboards, it was really easy to move around the keyboard, and I didn't feel the need to 'bottom-out' the keys. (Bottoming-out means pressing the keys all the way down). When I was first introduced to PC-gaming, it felt like I was breaking my keyboard at sometimes. For those that don't understand what I'm talking about, imagine your friend/cousin/relative playing on a game controller and button smashing. Now imagine doing that to your keyboard and then imagine it breaking a lot sooner after the wear and tear.

		Having a mechanical keyboard can help with the wear and tear because they're more durable. Here are the differences between the Cherry MXs: 
		<br/>
		<b>Cherry MX Brown</b>: No click sound, tactile feedback when pressed
		<br/><b>Cherry MX Blues</b>: High click sound, tactile feedback when pressed
		<br/><b>Cherry MX Reds</b>: no tactile feedback when pressed

	<p> I'm not a huge expert on keyboards but doing the research has definitely helped me learn about this little world of switches and builds. I hope you learned something and if you want to know more, head over here -- > For more information on keyboards, you can checkout this subreddit <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards">reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards</a>.
