		What are good questions? It depends.

		Whenever you ask a question, how detailed and how vague you can
		ask it will affect the answer you receive. I think a lot of it depends on what you're asking. Are you looking for a yes or no? Do you want it direct, do you need examples, etc. There's a lot to think about. 
	<p>
		One of the main things I'd get in trouble for as a kid was talking before thinking. As a result, nothing I'd ask would make any sense. Someone would ask me what ice cream flavor I want, I'd say, "Any ice cream." I'd get the sarcastic reply of, "That's not a flavor."

		After working customer service for so long, this was probably the worst thing you could say to any waiter or cashier. If they decide for you and you don't like it, you blame them. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The same goes for answering technical questions. Let's say you
		don't understand hashes in ruby, or you want to know why you're getting an error and you don't understand the error message. 
	</p>
	<p>
		You can go up to someone and say, "Hey, I don't really understand what the computer's trying to tell me. Can you explain it?"
	</p>
	<p> 
		Saying it like that only causes trouble if you don't specifically say where your error is or what you were trying to do. The other issue is if you just want someone to <b>tell you the answer</b> or if you're actually <b>trying to learn</b>. We've all had these lazy moments, that feeling where we just don't want to think anymore.
	</p>
	<p>
		The best questions are asked when you've done your research and read around. That way, when you ask your question, you can be specific. You could say something like, "Hey, so I understand this concept works like this and it uses this, but I still don't understand why it needs this or this to work." Even though I didn't use actual concepts in the sentence above, I've already setup someone to answer me. They know exactly what they don't need to say. In the above question, you're basically asking them to clear the cobwebs because you don't see a link between concepts that you think you should. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In short, exhaust all your brain power and resources before going up to someone, and if it's a question that requires a complicated answer, breakdown the questions into pieces. Ask the person through a process that makes sense to you and doesn't confuse the person you're asking.
