		When I first started this blog, I didn't think it would be as demanding as it became. There is something weirdly addicting about manipulating its look and constantly updating it with new content. it's really easy to lose track of time. I think for the most part, that's what's been that most challenge for me: time. 
	<P>
		I wish I could be at the point where I could just type out some code and know that it'll work immediately. For some elements, I know that's the case, but when it comes to the more 'stylish' looks for layouts, it takes time. For any type of creative process, some people focus on the symmetry or they're more on the colors, or maybe you just want something plain and functional. 
	</P>
	<p> For me, it's always been about color scheme and symmetry. I've always thought that symmetry and functionality went together. But with how portable technology's become, this might not be the case for someone looking at your website on their phones. At some point, I want to create a mobile version of my site and even buy a domain. But at this point, I don't think I'm quite ready yet.

		This might sound awkward, but it's kind of like DBC gave us our first coding baby to take care of. A website requires maintanence at least once a day and sometimes a whole new look that can span over mutiple days. New content also needs to be added to keep visitors coming back. There's a lot that goes into a single website. But it's important to remember that the index, or the first page of the website that a visitor sees, is the most important one. You're literally judging this website by its cover. It's important to get the visitor to want to look around, so the rest of your website should look just as attractive.
