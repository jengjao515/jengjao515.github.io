		You've seen it in all the movies, tv shows, and in the news. People
		being watched by all their beloved electronic devices. Some of my friends
		even admit to putting black tape over the cameras on their phones, laptops,
		and even unplugging their webcams. I came across 
		<a href= "https://www.yahoo.com/tech/report-hackers-can-eavesdrop-on-your-smart-home-115788791209.html">
		this</a> article in YahooNews. It talks about how any of our home devices could be hacked. 
			</p>
			<p>
		Sometimes when people think about internet security, they think about 
		how people can hack into your bank accounts or emails. But people watching you?
		It takes stalking to a whole other level. The scariest thing the article points out
		is that although your house alarm is supposed to keep intruders out, intruders
		can use it to know if anyone's home. 
			</p>
			<p>
		What's the point of having security if thieves who find out the alarm's on from the outside, 
		know they can walk in, maybe even let the alarm go off, and rush back out? Well, one of the main issues is that
		people continue to buy convenient technology. For example, when you connect your phone to your TV or 
		to the lights around your house. These luxuries aren't necessarily protected, or at least you wouldn't think they
		need one. But all someone would have to do is hack into your phone, and they could torment you by turning off and on 
		your lights. Makes you think twice about installing all those apps and new technology. Even baby monitors have been criticized 
		as being unsafe. There's been reports of people finding pictures of their children's cribs online. 
			</p>
			<p>
		So, how are companies trying to remedy the solution? Well, it's extremely difficult. 
		Some companies hire the hackers that hack them. Ironic, right? But it is pretty logical. You want
		the people that know the flaws of your system to point them out to you and possible fix them. 
		Security systems will slowly become more advanced, however, it is pretty daunting to know
		that some people can just type in a few lines of code to get access to your personal life.
