			Don't like group work? Too bad.

		At DBC, you're required to do at least <u>3 pairing sessions</u> a week
		and the purpose is so that you can learn from and get to know other students. 
		I absolutely hated any kind of group work in college and it's not that I minded
		the teamwork aspect, the problem was <b>if there would actually <u>BE</u> any kind
		of teamwork</b>. DBC approaches teamwork and pairing issues differently, they allow us
		to give anonymous feedback to each other, which is then looked over by DBC, and rated
		by other DBC students. 
		
		<p>
		My first pairing was completely nervewracking. I had no idea what to expect, despite 
		reading over the challenge we'd be going over. Although, I had just recently
		graduated, I was never good at properly communicating in group projects. Working alone
		was something I was good at because I'm horrible at explaining myself. 
		It was definitely rewarding when my partner was understanding but I knew that eventually
		my anxiety would come into play with someone less patient. During the more successful 
		pairings, my partner and I were able to work together through research and just
		enough communication. Probably the most frustrating thing so far is that there is a
		lot of discrepancy between students who've been studying several programming languages
		beforehand and those who are just starting. I like to participate in group work
		so since I'm pretty new to everything, it's frustrating when I can't properly 
		participate and slow my other partner down. Again, anxiety comes into play. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Before I even read my first few pieces of feedback, I already knew what most of them 
		were going to say. I'm pretty self-aware, so when I saw that most of them mentioned
		how quiet I was, well, I didn't really know what to do about it. I thought that 
		maybe if I studied harder, got the concepts better, this problem would just gradually
		go away with the confidence that comes with knowledge. But I am just naturally quiet, 
		if I start talking, sometimes I over compensate. I want to say that I hope 
		to develop finding a middle somehow, but I've struggled with this my whole life. 
		DBC wants us to create this awareness in our partner about how we're feeling before
		we get right to work. Sometimes I think about telling my partner, "Hey, so I'm just
		a really quiet person that isn't actually comfortable with speaking." I like letting my
		work speak for itself, but in the end, I know this isn't how the real world works.  
		</P>
		
		<p>
		<b>Communication is key</b> in pretty much every aspect of life. So I definitely 
		want to figure out this 'quiet' problem but I'm stuck. When I write feedback for other
		people, I feel bad because I think maybe it would've helped both of our performances
		if I communicated better. So when I pair with someone who's pretty patient, I always
		give better feedback because I'm less aware of how quiet I am, I actually feel
		comfortable. As a result, I write better feedback for this person which isn't fair
		for those that struggle with my quiet persona. 
		</p>

		<p> 
		I feel that DBC is using feedback to create less hostile work environments. They want 
		future programmers to not just be efficient in their work, but also, likeable. All this
		pairing and feedback makes me think about how I could apply it for future work environments. 
		It's also motivating because I'm not just learning how to program, but also how to be a people
		person. 
		</p>

		<p>
		My only critique is that I actually handle criticism pretty well. I really do take it in
		and think about it, so if I get feedback that's obviously holding back, I feel like
		I haven't really gotten anything from it. So if you pair with me and you don't like something, 
		you can even tell me during the pairing, I won't be offended. If it's the truth, at least, 
		I can do something about it and it'll be better for the both of us.
