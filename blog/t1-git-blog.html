			This week I learned about <b>version control</b>. Version control is a management system that keeps track of changes you make to a file. So, imagine your computer suddenly starts glitching out on you and all the Google searches in the world can't save you. You can choose any of the dates listed in your System Restore to go to back to a point when your computer was working perfectly (and hopefully, not make the same mistake that crashed your computer in the first place.). Version control works the same way but on a smaller scale. 
			<p>
			Version control is a way for developers to keep track of every "bug fix" or code change they make to any of their files. They have the option of going back to check any change they created on any of their files. So if their code crashes, or if they end up in a death trap that is the infinite loop, they can go back to see where they went wrong. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<i>Git</i> is one of these version control tools many developers use to keep track of their files. In the command prompt, you can use commands such as "git log" to see all the changes you've made for the entirety of that file's lifetime. In a weird way, you're stalking your code, you're making sure they grow up the way you want them, too, before you let them loose to the public eye. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Git? That sounds like <i>GitHub</i>. The difference between the two is that GitHub is online, git can be just on your own terminal. Github.com is a place for all developers to share their code through open sourcing. If you make all your code public on GitHub, you're allowing other developers to edit and use your code (but don't worry, they have to credit you! Don't forget your license!). It's always best to get a second opinion (if not thousands) on your code.
