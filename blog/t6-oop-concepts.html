		Ruby has a variety of variable types. But let's start with the basic stuff. 
		<p>
		Every variable has a scope type: <b>global</b> or <b>local</b>. 
	<P>	A <b>local variable</b> can only be accessed within where it was declared. If it 
		was created within a method or a class, it can only be used within those areas. Calling
		the variable outside will output an error in the terminal. 
	</p><P> A <b>global variable</b> can be accessed anywhere after the variable has been declared. 
		You can reference to past global variables declared in past code, but you can't
		reference to new variables down the code. 
		</P>
	<p>	<code>
		gvariable = "I am Groot!"
		
	<br/><br/>	def spaceship
	<br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; p "Hello!" + gvariable
	<br/>	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; lvariable = "I am Vin Diesel."
	<br/>	end
	<br/><br/>
		spaceship => "Hello! I am Groot!"
		<br/>p lvariable => This will not show "I am Vin Diesel." You will get an error.
		</code>
	</p><p> Now you know that Groot and Vin Diesel are in separate places. 
		Groot is the best, so he can show up whenever you need him to. But Vin Diesel's a
		busy guy so he's limited to when he can make an appearance.
