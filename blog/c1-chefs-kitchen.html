      			If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
			<p>
      			From the video, my take on the DBC experience is that it takes a lot of self-motivation and willpower. You need to be open-minded to not just learning, but also the experience. Shereef emphasizes that it's not like college where the most important thing is finding the right answer to a test in order to pass a class. This is really important because right answers is pretty much what college education is based on. No one really tells you to think outside the box or about how the multidudes of ways you can manipulate something. I mean, it depends on your professor, but most of the time you get the typical professor who teaches out of the book and at some point, gives you the answers to the test through a study session or something like that.

      			I think the idea of being in a room with people with the same goal, one that isn't based on a GPA score, will definitely be different and eye-opening. After being in school for so long, where the goal was to maintain some sort of average, seeing a different "end-game" will be something to get used to. 
			</p> 
			<p>
			My expectations for the program haven't changed at all. I knew when applying, it would be extremely demanding, and I think that's what I need to be successful. The demand, in a way, creates the kind of stress that motivates you towards whatever goal you came to DBC with. It makes me a little nervous because I just hope I can keep up.
