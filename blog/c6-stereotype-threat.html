		The Unfortunate case of a self-fulfilling prophecy

		During college, one of the most impactful lessons I'd ever learned was 
		the idea of <b>Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</b>, which has a lot to do with
		<b>stereotype threat</b>. I just threw a bunch of psychology terms at you 
		and now you're wondering what any of this has to do with technology or just anything
		relevant. 
		<p>
		<b>Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</b> is when someone or you expect something to occur
		from another person, and because of that expectation, you end up acting according
		to that expectation. Most of the time, this are negative expectations. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<b>Stereotype Threat</b> is when a person fears to confirm negative stereotypes
		about their culture/social group. 
		</p>
		<p> 
		So basically, stereotype threat influences you to commit the self-fulfilling prophecy. 
		You spend so much time avoiding it, you end up doing it. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For any minority, it's pretty nervewracking because you already feel like you're at 	
		a disadvantage. This might sound like a broken record for some people, but there really
		are near to no women in technology. Here, let me help you out here, I'm gonna write 
		down some phrases and without thinking, you're already gonna have some sort of visual, some 
		sort of automatic thought. 
		</p>
		<p>
		"Hey, man, tech's here to update the security." 
		<br/> "Can't believe the manager decided I couldn't get those days off." 
		<br/> "Really? You can't handle carrying one box?" 
		</P>
		<p> 
		Now, who did you see in your head? What did you think of? What did you feel? 
		Yes, I'm pulling some psyc tricks on you, but this is the reality. Of course, there
		are exceptions to the rule, but stereotype threat can apply to pretty much every situation. 
		</P>
		<p>
		We're human, we can't help it. We've become accustomed to it, we have to consciously
		think about giving someone the benefit of the doubt, that they are more than what they
		look like. But the real issue is that we're also conditioned to stereotype ourselves. 
		I'm a girl, I'm asian, and I'm young. Just with any of those words, you're probably
		visualizing some tiny asian girl that needs help a lot. Nah. Try again. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I play video games, my credit score is great, I drive according to the rules, average size, 
		and I absolutely hate fake-sounding high-pitched voices. But even though I know these things
		about myself, I'm completely aware of what people think of me at first glance. And that is
		terrifying. Conditioned with this idea, I already have a disadvantage of that anxiety. I 
		have to feel like I have to work harder, to compensate for what I look like, what I seem like. 
		And that anxiety inhibits my actual ability. Going into any interview, I am terrified, I feel 
		like in any group project, I have to work harder to make my presence known. But then again, 
		there's the issue of being aggressive, because that's just not feminine at all. It's a lot 
		of extra thinking that I could be using to work on something more productive. 
		</p>
		<p>
		It makes expressing myself more difficulty and could cause problems in the workplace. I end up
		doing exactly what everyone expects me to do, act like a girl, the version of me that's not exactly
		me, but is a part of me, or at least that's what everyone tells me.
