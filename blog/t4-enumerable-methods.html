		The technical definition for <b>.map</b> is that it uses blocking to 
		make changes to each element in an array that it's attached to. 
		Most of the definitions you look up for Ruby enumerables all sound exactly
		like this. .collect and .each also have similar definitions, which is probably
		a lot of the reason I had difficulty learning about Ruby this week. 
		But even though it might not look like it when you write out the actual code,
		there are slight differences. 
			</p>
			<p>
		The .map method looks like this in code:
			</p>
			<p align=center>
			<code>
			array_name = [ 1, 2, 3 ] 
			array_name.map { |e| e * 2 } 
			</code> 
			</p>
			<p> And here's the output: </p>
			<p align=center>
			<code>
			array_name = [ 2, 4, 6 ] 
			</code>
			</p>
			<p>
		The code block, the right part of the code in  <b>' { } '</b>, tells the .map 
		method to do whatever's inside those squiggly lines/curly braces to each element
		in an array. Now, how is this different? Well, bear with me here, it's going
		to sound more confusing than it actually is. <i>The .map method changes each element, 
		unlike .each, which adds to each element.</i> 
			</p>
			<p>
		Not clicking? I wouldn't be surprised. It took me awhile, too. The best example I can think of
		is chicken nuggets. Yes, this is a stretch, a really big stretch when explaining this method, 
		but give it a chance. 
		</p>
			<p>
		As a kid, I absolutely hated chicken nuggets without sauce. So let's start off by relating 
		this idea to the .each method. Let's say an array is this bowl of chicken nuggets. 
		But I wanted sauce, so my mom would always put sauce on the side of plate. So, now I have chicken
		nuggets and sauce, but technically, I haven't really changed anything to the chicken nuggets. 
		This is how the .each method works, add something to each element, but you're not changing the original
		element. (This also means .each is never 'destructive', which I will get to later.) 		
			</p>
			<p>
		The .map method actually adds changes to the original elements in an array. So this could be when you
		cook the chicken nuggets. Usually, they come in one of those huge frozen Costco bags. In order for them
		to be edible, you'd cook them in an oven or a microwave. This is what the .map method can do, change
		the nuggets from frozen to cooked.
			</p>
			<p>
		See? I told you it was a stretch. But hopefully that made some sort of sense. 
		Now, to add maybe even a little more confusion, there are two versions to the .map method. 
		<b>.map</b> and <b>.map!</b>. 
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Destructive and Non-destructive</b>
			<br/>
			<b>.map</b> does not make any permanent changes to the original array. Going back to our
			chicken nuggets example, yes, you've changed the nuggets from frozen to cooked, but essentially, 
			they're still chicken nuggets. This would be the <b>non-destructive</b> version of .map. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In order to make it <b>destructive</b>, you would change <i>.map</i> to <i>.map!</i>. 
			Using the nuggets example again, let's say you've overcooked the nuggets, these nuggets are no 
			longer edible. It doesn't even taste like chicken anymore, it tastes like straight charcoal. 
			You can't even classify it as chicken anymore, it is just black meat.
			The .map! method permanently changes the original array, so now when you use that array 
			for other methods, you will get the array with the changes. 	
			</p>
			<p>
			I don't know why I thought of chicken nuggets and ketchup, but hopefully, you won't think of
			enumerables and chicken all the time, unless this example helps. I'm still hoping it does. Thanks
			for reading, though!
