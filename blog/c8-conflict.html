		One conflict I had in the past was during college. Originally, I went into college as a Pre-Occupational Therapy major. Unfortuantely, I started college during the worst possible time for the American economy and about two years into my prerequisites, they cancelled the program, and left the master's program. 

	<p>	Yes, it's as bad as it sounds. </p>
	<p>	So, I had a choice, I could take this random list of classes they gave me to still "technically" graduate with a B.S. and
		then re-apply to the master's program. Before they cancelled Pre-OT, you would do pre-requisites for 2 years, apply to the OT B.S., and be done 3 years later. Afterwards, you would apply for the master's, and graduate 1 year later. Without this system, 
		the rest of us were left to either switch majors or take this list of classes. As a result, it made entry to the master's program that much more competitive. 
	</p>
	<p>	In the end, I took it as a sign that maybe the medical field wasn't for me. So, I got lost in the system. </p>
	<p> I spent a whole year of my college career trying to figure out what to do. With nearly all of the 'ideal' programs impacted, 
		it was near to impossible to switch majors. Yes, it's as stressful as it sounds. 
	</p>
	<p> In the late part of that year, I decided on Psychology as a backup because I had already taken (and passed) so many of those 	classes in preparation for OT. During the summer, I decided on Psychology because I would graduate a year later. 
	</p>
	<p> I was absolutely miserable through this whole process. Usually, I liked learning, knowing this knowledge would be useful in a 
		career one day. But after going back and forth, being told no so many times, getting stuck, then stuck again, I hated school. I hated San Jose State, and I just wanted it to be over. 
	</p>
	<p> I took the time in my last semester of college to decide what to do. I worked more hours at Starbucks and talked to people who 		were in actual careers, which, ironically, were usually Cisco and Samsung employees. They eventually convinced me to at least 
		consider going back into technology. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking back, I honestly don't know what I would've done differently. The hardest part about that year was deciding to stay and try or drop out and just work. The part that swayed me to stay was that I had already invested so much time into SJSU, even though they weren't investing anytime into me, or at least that's who I felt. I decided to work with the system, even though it was working against me. I tried to fight the irony and ended up with a degree. I got half of what I wanted because a Psyc degree doesn't get you as far as a PhD or PsyD. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The way I see it, I try not to look back on that part of my life. I always refer to it as a "Dark Time". I went through a lot of personal issues and the situation definitely ruined my state of mind. I try to just be thankful that I even got out because a lot of people I know are either still there, sifting their way through the mess.
